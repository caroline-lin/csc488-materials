What to submit / How to submit Assignment 2

1)  Submit tar ball named csc488h.A2.XY.tar (where XY is your team number).
    If more than one tar ball is submitted by a team we will use the most
    recent one. Like this:

   submit -c csc488h csc488h.A2.XY.tar

   See "man submit" on CDF for more information.

The tar ball should contain:

a)  A README.A2 file that describes what each team member did for this assignment.

b)  Your csc488.cup file.

    We will use this file with the Assignment 2 starter code to build a parser
    and run that parser on our test cases.

c)  A design document that describes how you designed your csc488.cup file.
    Explain the issues that arose with the source language reference grammar
    and how you resolved those issues.

d)  A tests directory containing all of the test cases that you used to
    test your compiler. There should be two subdirectories:

       tests/passing - tests for the correct operation of the parser (legal programs)
       tests/failing - test to demonstrate handling of syntax errors (invalid programs)

    Include a shell script RUNALLTESTS.sh that will run your compiler against all
    of your test cases. Model it after the RUNCOMPILER.sh file we provided.

e)  A document describing how you tested your csc488.cup file.
    Include an index with a one sentence description of each test case.

No hardcopy is required for this assignment.

NOTES

1)  The file/directory names and the name of the tarball itself are
    *case sensitive*. Please try to hard to get the names exactly
    right so you don't break our automated processing scripts.

2)  The documents you submit in the tarball should be in a format that is
    easy to read on CDF. In general this means text files or PDF files.
    Do not submit Microsoft Word files.

3)  Follow the directory structure described here.
    Do not add extra directories (e.g. everying in an A2 directory)
    Doing so breaks our automated unpacking/testing tools.
